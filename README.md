# Software Reverse Engineering - Coursework with C++ and x86 assembly

<p>
This repository contains the major course work that was completed during my semester studying software reverse engineering. The focus of this course was to understand how C++ code is converted into x86 Assembly. We were required to develop an intimate understanding of x86 assembly, and how assembly operations complete work that is required from the higher level language used to write the initial code.
